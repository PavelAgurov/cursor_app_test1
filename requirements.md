   - Show loading state during authentication
3. Authenticated state
   - Store authentication status in local storage
   - Redirect to main app after successful login
   - Display username in the main app
   - Provide logout functionality

#### Backend
1. Authentication API
   - POST `/api/login`: Validates user credentials
2. User data storage
   - Users stored in `data/users.yaml` file
   - Each user has username and password fields
3. Response Format
   - JSON object with `success` and `message` fields

#### Non-Functional Requirements

## User Story: Hello Button Functionality

### Description
As an authenticated user, I want to click a "Hello" button on the webpage and receive a greeting from the backend server.

### Detailed Requirements

#### Frontend
1. Single page web application using React and TypeScript
2. UI Components:
   - Main page with a centered "Hello" button
   - Area to display the response from the backend
3. Button Interaction:
   - On click, the button should trigger an API call to the backend
   - Display loading state while waiting for the response

#### Backend
1. Node.js server with TypeScript
2. API Endpoints:
   - GET `/api/hello`: Returns a JSON response with a greeting message

#### Data Flow
1. User logs in with valid credentials
2. After successful authentication, user sees the Hello button
3. User clicks the "Hello" button on the frontend
4. Frontend sends a GET request to the backend endpoint `/api/hello`
5. Backend processes the request and returns a greeting message
6. Frontend displays the received message to the user

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Type safety throughout the application using TypeScript
2. Proper error handling for API requests
